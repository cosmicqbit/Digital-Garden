## Bitten by Snake
> If bitten by a snake, üêçwash with peroxide, it oxidizes any organic matter. If stung by Hymenoptera (wasps, bees, bumblebees, etc.) then apply a mini compress of ammonia, ammonia neutralizes the poisons of these insects perfectly. If bitten by spiders, within a minute or two cauterize the place of bite with a match, put a sulfur head to the affected place, and set fire to another. The venom mostly decomposes from the high temperature, and the burn traumatized tissues and capillaries do not allow the residual toxins to flow freely into the blood. These remedies are naturally not a cure-all, but at least when used early in the absence of an antidote, they greatly limit the amount of poison, alleviate the effects, and allow time to seek more qualified help
